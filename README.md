<h1>🚖 OLA Ride Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)</h1>
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze OLA ride-hailing data, providing insights into bookings, revenue, vehicle performance, cancellations, and ratings to support data-driven business decisions.

<h2>📌 Project Overview / Purpose</h2>

The OLA Ride Analytics Dashboard is a comprehensive Power BI report built to monitor and analyze ride booking behavior across multiple dimensions such as vehicle type, payment method, cancellations, revenue trends, and customer/driver ratings.

• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Measures, KPIs, and calculated insights <br>
• 🧩 Data Modeling – Relationships between bookings, vehicles, customers, drivers, and payments <br>
• 🗂 File Formats - .pbix – Power BI development file and .png – Dashboard preview screenshots for GitHub

<h2>✨ Features & Dashboard Highlights
🔍 Business Problem </h2>

Ride-hailing companies like OLA generate massive booking data daily, but raw data alone does not clearly answer questions such as:

• Which vehicle types generate the most revenue?

• Why are rides getting cancelled?

• Which payment methods are preferred?

• How satisfied are customers and drivers?

• What are the booking trends over time?

<h2>🎯 Goal of the Dashboard </h2>

To provide an interactive and visual analytics solution that:

• Tracks overall booking and revenue performance

• Identifies cancellation patterns and root causes

• Compares vehicle performance and ride distances

• Monitors customer and driver satisfaction

• Supports operational and strategic decision-making
