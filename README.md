Ride-hailing companies like OLA generate massive booking data daily, but raw data alone does not clearly answer questions such as:

Which vehicle types generate the most revenue?

Why are rides getting cancelled?

Which payment methods are preferred?

How satisfied are customers and drivers?

What are the booking trends over time?

🎯 Goal of the Dashboard

To provide an interactive and visual analytics solution that:
